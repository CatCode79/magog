A fantasy deathcrawl in Rust

Work in progress.

To run, with Rust compiler and Cargo package manager installed:

    cargo run --release

When building on Windows, you may need to have MinGW gcc installed
and in PATH for cargo to be able to build all the necessary
dependencies.

Instructions
------------

Better UX is planned. Current gameplay is keyboard only:

QWE,ASD: move around

I: View inventory, equip item (ESC exits)

U: Use item in inventory (ESC exits)

G, B: Get item, drop item

Space: Wait for turn
