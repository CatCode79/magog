* Obvious stuff

* Non-critical stuff
	These don't make new features.
	* TODO Switch GL bindings from opengles to gl-rs
		Seems to be becoming the defacto Rust OpenGL bindings.
	* TODO Offline image processing
		Drop image and ttf loading from the end result binaries, make them
		smaller and faster to start up.

		Write an external utility that builds atlas textures from images and
		rasterized fonts and converts these into bitmap data. Compress
		texture data bytes with crate flate and bake into the binary as
		embedded data. Will also need to emit a metadata structure to list
		the sprite bounds. Static struct literals should work.

		Can add additional image processing steps instead of just turning
		the images as is into sprites as is done now. One example would be
		using a bright color as the transparent one for the sprites, which
		end up having #000000 as the transparent color as end result
		textures.
	* TODO Use color-rs for the colors
	* TODO Use hgl-rs, replace parts of glutil with it
		It's using gl-rs, so I'd need to transition to that.
